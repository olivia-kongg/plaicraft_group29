    "### Introduction\n",
    "This project is based on datasets that have been provided by a research group in Computer Science at UBC who obtained data regarding how individuals play video games. They did this through recording player actions in a MineCraft Server, and collecting data regarding information about each individual as well as how they play. This data has been condensed into the datasets of **Players** and **Sessions**. The question our group has chosen to answer is Question 3 provided in the criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3**: We would like to know something about our populations of users, in particular, we would like to have a good model of whether or not a player will continue contributing given past participation. \n",

    "## Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "## Players Data\n",
    "  The players.csv filed is a data set containing information about the players in the game. There are 196 observations with data about the players such as their experience, whether they subscribe, their email, the number of hours played, their names, gender and age. These categories are split into the 9 variables (column names) below. \n",

    "| experience       | String  | The level of expertise that the player has in the game. Possible values are \"Amateur\", \"Beginner\", \"Regular\", \"Pro\", \"Veteran\". This is a categorical variable.              |\n",
    "| subscribe        | Boolean | Whether or not the player has subscribed to the game. The variable can only take the value \"TRUE\" or \"FALSE\", indicating \"yes\"  or \"no\" to whether they are subscribed.  |\n",

    "Using data available about **Players** and **Sessions of Players**, the goal of this project is to predict player retention, whether a player will continue playing the game based on the data from the two given dataframes. The column \"subscribe\" is the categorical variable we are trying to predict, and this is based on our assumption that a players subscribing to the game will continue to play it. The two varaibles chosen to predict this are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Total number of hours played\n",
    "2. Average session time per player\n",
    "\n",
    "This will require a KNN classification model with the most optimal K value, and the two above quantitative predictor variables. The data will also be split into training and test sets to evaluate the classifer model's performance using accuracy, recall and precision. Through cross validation, an optimal k-value will be chosen. \n",
